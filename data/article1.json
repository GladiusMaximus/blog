	, "body": "<p>Today in class, I worked on the networking with my team mates. First we had to decide on a network protocol for sending JSON objects to/from the server.</p><p>Our first idea was to use http. The client would GET an http page with the client's ID in the query string, and then the server would respond (based on whatever else is in the query string) with a JSON object. The advantage is that most languages have a good HTTP library and it is relatively light weight. The disadvantage is that it needs the client to continually refresh the page. The server can't prompt the client.</p><p>We thought about using a raw TCP over TLS connection. The server could prompt the client or the other way around. The connection is also common to most languages. On the other hand, since it is such a low level, it is harder to work with.</p><p>Then we finally decided on websockets. It may be a little harder to set up in languages that don't have a library for this, but most modern languages do have a library for it. It can be encrypted if necessary, and it integrates well with Node JS.</p><p>We also diagrammed the network protocol for our app on the white board. We planned out the order of the network messages and how the clients would know when the server is ready.</p>
