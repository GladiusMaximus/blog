Work on Manateams (the grade scraping program) has been slow. You can see my progress <a href="https://github.com/project-manatee/manatee-chrome">here</a>.I have been working on refactoring the code to make it more encapsualted. Right now, all of the functionality is sort of mixed together in source code. I am trying to seperate it into logical units.

APCS Challenge of the Week:
Figure out how to use lambda functions in Java 7.
</pre>
I am not in APCS, nevertheless I will explain how to write lambdas in Java 7 and Java 8. It soudns more interesting than my project.
</p>
<p>
A Lambda expression is like an insta-function. It instantly creates a function usually to do a small task where writing a real function would be too verbose.
If I say $f(x) = x^2$, I made a function called $f$. Another way of writing this is $f = \lambda x. x^2$.
</p>
<p>
Let say I want to have a function that square a number. I could make a static method. This is analagous to $f(x) = x^2; f(10)$
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Test {
	public static double f(double x) {
		return Math.pow(x, 2);
	}
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println(f(10.0));
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Or I could make a lambda function (Java 7 style) by creating a one-use throw-away function. This is analagous to $(\lambda x.x^2)(10)$. The function isn't even given a name.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Test {
	interface Function<A, R> {
		public R run(A argument);
	}

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println(
			new Function<Double, Double>() {
				public Double run(Double argument) {
					return Math.pow(argument, 2);
				}
			}.run(10.0)
		);
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The nice thing about this is that I can pass a function to a function. Java has an array sorter built in. If I want to sort arrays full of objects that Java doesn't know how to compare, I have to tell Java how to compare them. I do that by passing in a 'comperator'.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Collections.sort(chairs, new Comparator<Chair>() {
	public int compare(Chair chair1, Chair chair2) {
		// tell Java how to compare two Chairs.
		...
		// returns -1 if less than, 0 if equal, 1 if greater than
	}
});
</code></pre>

Java 7 syntax doesn't directly let us make lambda-functions. Instead we make anonymous classes that have a method which acts like a function. This makes lambdas sort of inconvenient (remember the whole point of lambda expressions is that they can be more concise than a static method in some cases). Java 8 fixes this by implementing lambdas directly.
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Test {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println(
			(x -> Math.pow(x, 2))(10.0)
	 	);
	}
}
// This code is untested
// I am certain it works, but getting JDK 8 on Debian is time-consuming
// and I still have lots of English homework to do.

This is much easier to use and it approximates $(\lambda x.x^2)(10)$ much better. Read more about lambda functions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">here</a>.
