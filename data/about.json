Eventually I intend to post here because I want to, not because I have to.</p><p>I enjoy learning, and I have a passion for studying computer science. I taught myself Python, Java, C, C++, Javascript, SQL, as well as broader topics like linux server management, web app design (I built this blog in Node.JS), etc. </p><p>While I like studying computer science, that isn't my whole life. I enjoy learning about Physics and Math. Still, STEM isn't my whole life. I go to a multi-disciplinary school. I learn about history, philosophy, and Latin. In my free time (what little I have), I run cross country, play piano, and write a blog.</p>"
