<p>How do RC circuits work when the resistor and capacitor are in parallel?</p>
<p>When in series, the resistor limits the flow to the capacitor and the capacitor charges slowly, according to $ V_c(t) = V_0 (1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}) $. This is means that the voltage across the capacitor ($V_c$) will slowly approach the voltage put accross it ($V_0$).</p>
<p>What will the capacitor and resistor do in parallel? Presumably in parallel, the capacitor will slowly charge, and the voltage across the capacitor will slowly approach the voltage applied, but how? If we let the capacitor be a series RC circuit with a resistor of resistance zero, and then that RC circuit in parallel with another resistor, then we might be able to solve this. But then we look at the $RC$ constant, which is zero because of the zero resistor. Therefore it charges instantly. This doesn't seem right.</p>
<p> Going back to the series case, lets solve for the equivalent resistance of the capacitor changes with time ($R_{eq}(t)$). Lets say we are applying a voltage ($V_0$) across a resistor ($R_a$) and a capacitor (with resistance $R_c(t)$) in series. Voltage across the resistor is given by (variation on stated above) $ V_c(t) = V_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} $. Voltage across the resistor is also given in terms of the time-dependent equivalent resistence of the capacitor: $ V_c(t) = I R_a = \frac {V_0} {R_{eq}(t)} R_a = \frac {v_0} {R_a + R_c(t)} R_a $. By setting these two quantities equal to each other, we find $ R_c(t) = R_a (1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}) $.</p>
<p>Thus, we can go back to the capacitor in parallel with the resistor, we can make a second attempt. Lets consider the capacitor to be an RC circuit with a zero resistor in parallel with a real resistor. We find that the resistance is zero, and again, the capacitor charges instantly. This still doesn't seem right, since as soon as the capacitor charges a little bit, it resists charging further.</p>
<p>I have only seen solutions of this problem for the AC case, not the DC case. I don't really know how it works. I suppose it would be difficult but possible to test empirically.</p>
