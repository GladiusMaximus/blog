For the past week I have been working on a chrome extension that will fetch a students grades for them. My school district has set up a new web-frontend that is very inconvenient and too slow for most people. My extension will fetch grades every five minutes or so, cache the results, and display them when asked by the user.

The chrome extension API is pretty good. Storing local data in chrome is a breeze. We (me and Ryan, who is also working on this) used JQuery to parse the page that the grading program (TEAMS) returns. We used RequireJS to link together all of the javascript sources. We need some way to route the user to different pages based on if the user is logged in, if the user clicks a button, etc.

<h3>Enter AngularJS</h3>
<p>
AngularJS is a web framework. This means it helps you render dynamic pages. It can change HTML based on a Javascript variable on the fly. It can even change which template to render. Making AngularJS work is difficult, but once you do get it to work, it simplifies a lot of your code.
