For the past month, I have been working on a CTF competition. Capture The Flag (in the context of computer science) is a computer security game where the competitors are given problems that have hidden flags. With the competitors knowledge in cryptography, reverse engineering, and exploitation, the competitors unlock the flags to receive points. For example, one problem could ask you to decrypt some ciphertext without a key by breaking the encryption.

So far, I have competed in <a href="https://picoctf.com/">PicoCTF</a> with my team Steam Locomotive. We <a href="https://picoctf.com/scoreboard">placed 18th</a> nationally. I am currently competing in <a href="http://www.easyctf.com/">EasyCTF</a> with the same team, hopefully we will do just as well or better.

In addition to competing, I have written solutions to the problems in PicoCTF after the CTF was over. They are available <a href="http://ehsandev.com/pico2014/">here</a>. I wrote six of our writeups, primarily in the Cryptography section. Two (<a href="http://ehsandev.com/pico2014/binary_exploitation/OBO.html">OBO</a> and <a href="http://ehsandev.com/pico2014/cryptography/web_interception.html">Web Interception</a>) of the solutions I wrote made it to the top three viewed solutions. <a href="http://ehsandev.com/pico2014/cryptography/web_interception.html">Web Interception</a> was a very fun problem, and I recommend you take a look at it. I think my explanation of <a href="http://ehsandev.com/pico2014/cryptography/substitution.html">how to crack substitution ciphers</a>, although it isn't very difficult for experienced people, is rather good; I certainly spent a lot of time on it. I go through each pass of the cipher text, replacing the characters that were guessed in the previous cipher text, and guessing more. First I am guessing single letters based on character frequency, then bigrams and trigrams, then whole words.

The most important experience I got from CTFs is working in a team. For the easy problems, each team member takes a different problem and solves it individually, for the most part. But for the more complicated questions, it takes collaboration. We all look over each others work. It feels amazing when I am working with a team of other people, and I make a breakthrough. I am thinking "I can't way to tell the others about this!" Cracking OBO probably took the most collaboration from all of us. That is what makes it really fun.
