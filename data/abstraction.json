Specifically, I worked on hashing out the code that makes the clients talk to the server over web sockets. You can see my work <a href=\"https://github.com/Oksisane/GameHost/commit/476d2243eae037eac8a12a66849d7f468bb06240\">here</a>. I tried to use a feature of Socket.io called <a href=\"http://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/#rooms\">rooms</a>. A room could allow me to broadcast to multiple sockets at one time. I couldn't get it to work ebcause it was too poorly documented, so I justed looped over all sockets.</p><p>Then I worked on game logic. Now that the clients can communicate with the servers, I tried to get server to actually serve a usable game. We started with tictactoe, because it was so simple. The server has to reject bad moves, make users take turns, and detect when someone wins. <a href=\"https://github.com/Oksisane/GameHost/commit/b386126bcd7f9276bba70b57f81f4f1f6a557660\">Here</a> is my code.</p><p>Since my project is in a public git repository hosted on GitHub, you can see all of the work I am doing online. <a href=\"https://github.com/Oksisane/GameHost\">Here</a> is the proejct root where you can browse the code, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Oksisane/GameHost/commits/master\">here</a> is the commit stream where you can see all of the progress we make. Even though a commit may be published after class, it is almost always includes code I worked on during class. Today in class, I hope to make sure that the abstractions are bullet proof, and make sure the project is modular. Then, I could try implementing another game, using the existing platform to test its interfaces between layers.</p>"
